# Zero-Day Malware Security System
## Data Wars - Meraz'18, malware security partner Max Secure Software

**Zero-day** : A zero-day vulnerability is a computer-software vulnerability that is unknown to those who would be interested in mitigating the vulnerability. Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect computer programs, data, additional computers or a network.

**Zero-day-malware** cannot be caught as such using the conventional malware detection system which heavily depend on the manual creation of signature to detect malware files, based of the research done in Max Secure Software laboratories, it was found out that Machine learning techniques could perform well in detecting zero-day vulnerabilities (focused of malware files), if trained properly on suitable models.

The raw data here was obtained from the malware security partner of Meraz'18 - Annual Techno Cultural festival of IIT Bhilai, the said raw data constituted malware and legitimate files.

Malware represents software which is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain authorised access to a computer system. Legitimate files are software that don't behave like malware and are useful and harmless to the users.

Statistical analysis was done on these files which mainly constituted the extraction of PE information and calculation of entropy of different sections of these files.

This security system use different Machine Learning techniques to classify files are malware or legitimate.
